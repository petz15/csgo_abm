# CS:GO Agent-Based Economy Model (CSGO_ABM)

This project implements an agent-based model simulating the economy aspect of Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (CS:GO). The simulation focuses on how teams manage their finances, make investment decisions, and the impact of these decisions on game outcomes through probabilistic models.

## Probability Models

The simulation uses several probability models to determine outcomes:

   - Uses Tullock contest model with adjustable parameter r
   - Higher r values make outcomes more deterministic

2. **CSF Normal Distribution**: Generates values from a normal distribution with:
   - Mean positioned according to the CSF probability
   - Standard deviation set to 1/4 of the output range
   - Configurable output range for different game aspects

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/petz15/csgo_abm.git
   cd csgo_abm
   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```
   go mod tidy
   ```

3. Run the simulation:
   ```
   go run cmd/main.go
   ```

## Usage

### Running Large-Scale Simulations

The parallel simulation system is optimized for large-scale runs:

```bash
# Run 100,000 simulations with 16 workers and 2GB memory limit
go run ./cmd -n 100000 -c 16 -m 2000

# Quick performance test with monitoring
go run ./cmd -n 10000 -c 8
```

#### Performance Optimizations

- **Automatic scaling**: Memory limits and worker counts adjust for very large simulations (100k+)
- **Progress monitoring**: Real-time updates every 10-30 seconds depending on simulation size
- **Memory management**: Automatic garbage collection when memory usage exceeds limits
- **Bounded growth**: Score distribution tracking limited to prevent memory issues
- **Graceful shutdown**: Proper cleanup even if interrupted

#### Simulation Output

Each parallel run creates a timestamped directory containing:
- `simulation_summary.json`: Aggregate statistics and performance metrics
- Individual simulation results (if enabled)
- Memory usage and performance data

Example summary output:
```json
{
  "total_simulations": 10000,
  "completed_simulations": 10000,
  "team1_wins": 5234,
  "team2_wins": 4766,
  "team1_win_rate": 52.34,
  "team2_win_rate": 47.66,
  "average_rounds": 28.7,
  "overtime_rate": 23.4,
  "execution_time": "45.2s",
  "simulations_per_second": 221.2,
  "peak_memory_usage_mb": 1847,
  "total_gc_runs": 12
}
```

#### Command-Line Arguments

- `-n, --num <number>`: Number of simulations to run (default: 1)
- `-c, --cores <number>`: Number of concurrent workers (default: number of CPU cores)
- `-m, --memory <MB>`: Memory limit in MB before forcing garbage collection (default: 1000)

### Performance Benchmarks

Based on testing with the improved concurrency implementation:

| Simulations | Workers | Memory Limit | Avg. Time | Rate (sims/sec) | Peak Memory |
|-------------|---------|--------------|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| 1,000       | 4       | 1000MB       | 4.2s      | 238/sec         | 145MB       |
| 10,000      | 8       | 1000MB       | 42s       | 238/sec         | 520MB       |
| 100,000     | 16      | 2000MB       | 7.1min    | 234/sec         | 1.8GB       |

*Results may vary based on hardware specifications and strategy complexity.*

### Creating Custom Strategies

To implement a custom strategy:

1. Create a new file in the `internal/models` directory
2. Implement a function with the signature:
   ```go
   func InvestDecisionMaking_yourStrategy(funds float64, curround int, curscoreopo int) float64
   ```
3. Add your strategy to the strategy manager:
   ```go
   // In internal/engine/strategymanager.go
   case "your_strategy":
       return models.InvestDecisionMaking_yourStrategy(team.Funds, curround, curscoreopo)
   ```

## Technical Implementation

### Concurrency Architecture

The simulation uses a robust worker pool pattern with the following components:

1. **Worker Pool**: Manages a fixed number of goroutines for simulation processing
2. **Job Queue**: Buffered channel for distributing simulation tasks
3. **Result Collection**: Dedicated goroutine for aggregating simulation results
4. **Memory Monitoring**: Background goroutine tracking memory usage and triggering GC
5. **Progress Reporting**: Real-time status updates during long-running simulations

### Memory Management

- **Bounded Data Structures**: Score distribution limited to 1000 unique entries
- **Automatic GC**: Triggered when memory usage exceeds configured limits
- **Atomic Operations**: Race-condition-free statistics updates
- **Resource Cleanup**: Guaranteed cleanup of all goroutines and channels

### Error Handling

- **Timeout Protection**: Individual simulations timeout after 5 minutes
- **Panic Recovery**: Graceful handling of simulation panics
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues operation even with partial failures
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed error reporting for debugging

### Analyzing Results

Results are exported as JSON files with unique identifiers:
- **Individual Results**: Format `YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_hostname_randomID.json`
- **Summary Statistics**: Aggregate data in `simulation_summary.json`
- **Performance Metrics**: Execution time, processing rate, memory usage

The summary includes:
- Win rates and score distributions for both teams
- Average rounds per game and overtime statistics
- Performance metrics (simulations/second, peak memory usage)
- System resource utilization data

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Memory Usage Growth**:

- Reduce number of concurrent workers
- Monitor with built-in memory tracking

**Hanging Simulations**:
- Check for infinite loops in custom strategies
- Verify timeout settings (default: 5 minutes per simulation)
- Use sequential mode for debugging: `simulation_sequential.go`

**Performance Issues**:
- Optimize worker count (typically 1-2x CPU cores)
- Ensure adequate system memory
- Consider reducing simulation complexity for large runs

### Debug Mode

For debugging individual simulations:
```bash
# Run single simulation with detailed output
go run ./cmd -n 1 -c 1

# Use sequential implementation for step-by-step debugging
# (modify main.go to call sequentialsimulation instead)
```
